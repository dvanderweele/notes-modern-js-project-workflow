# Notes on Modern JavaScript Project Workflow
These notes are derived from the Code Realm YouTube channel's React / JS Project Lifecycle playlist; I have no affiliation with the channel. These notes are more focused on the vanilla JavaScript aspects of the workflow, but for the sake of completeness I suppose some of the React-related notes will be included. I'm not focused on recreating the React CSS Spinners project he did, but instead I'm just documenting the overall process.
